Srt Movie Split
===============

Splits a video based on words from the subtitles.

Have you ever seen a movie mash-up of all the mentions of a word in a movie?

This script makes it easy to do these kinds of movies by stitching together the relevant parts based on a regex word search in the subtitles.
You can easily make a movie like this one : [The Wolf of Wall Street: Just the 'F' Words - Supercut](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mn49DiI9Gag)
